-- You should create your first admin user through the Supabase dashboard or using the Supabase CLI.
-- After creating a user via auth.users, update their profile role:

-- Example (replace with your actual user ID):
-- UPDATE profiles SET role = 'admin' WHERE id = 'your-user-id-here';

-- Or if you want to set a specific email as admin after they sign up:
-- UPDATE profiles SET role = 'admin' WHERE email = 'admin@whiskyclub.com';
