# Event Featured Images

Place your event featured images in this directory.

## How to Use

1. **Copy your image** to this directory:
   ```bash
   cp ~/path/to/your-image.jpg public/images/events/
   ```

2. **When creating/editing an event**, use the path in the Featured Image field:
   ```
   /images/events/your-image.jpg
   ```
